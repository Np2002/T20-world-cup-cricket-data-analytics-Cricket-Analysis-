# T20-world-cup-cricket-data-analytics-Cricket-Analysis-

‚Ä¢	Created a Power BI report to identify top 11 players for a T20 cricket team by scraping data from espncricinfo with a webscrapper website tool, cleaning and trasforming the data with pandas, and evaluating various player performance metrics.

‚Ä¢	Used the resulting Power BI dashbaord to select players for various categories (openers, middle order/anchors, finishers, all-rounders, specialist fast bowlers) and ultimately choose the top 11 players to play in the match.

‚Ä¢	Selected team using the Power BI dashboard has 90% of chances to win the game.
